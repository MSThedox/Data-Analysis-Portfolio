In our ***TotalMinutesAsleep Vs TotalSteps*** Viz, it seems that, women having total steps between 5000-10000 per day, having a good sleep record. Also, walking nearby 10000 steps is a standard for female, recommended by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/pdf/postcurriculum_session8.pdf).

When BMI is over 24.9, that indicates overweight. In our ***Distance Vs BMI*** Viz, we are seeing that overweight women are more willing to lose their weight by walking more distance. So, women who are  fatty, they can use bellabeat products to be slim with more willing.\n","* Suppose anyone want to follow a diet where how much time she should consume at her walking is described. At her fifty minute's walking, her instructor said that she should do more fairly activities. So, she can use bellabeat products to follow instructions as we see at ***Type of Activity*** phase.\n","* It's always good to having medium heart rate. When a user do more exercise/activity it'll be bad for her. Also, at sleeping heart rate becomes slow as we see at ***Heart rate Vs Hour*** graph. So, bellabeat products can be good assistant when to sleep or measuring type of activities.\n","* It's a good trend to consume calories at week days same as weekend at ***Calories Vs Days*** graph. So, when a user will be so busy in her daily activities, bellabeat products reminder will help her to burn her calory."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
