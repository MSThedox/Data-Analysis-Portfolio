At the end of each year, Spotify compiles a playlist of the songs streamed most often over the course of that year. This year's playlist (Top Tracks of 2021) includes 50 songs.
The objective in this project is to look for patterns in the audio features of the songs  and find why people stream these songs the most.
The audio features for each song were extracted using the Spotify Web API and the spotipy Python library.
