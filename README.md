At the end of each year, Spotify compiles a playlist of the songs streamed most often over the course of that year. This year's playlist (Top Tracks of 2021) includes 50 songs.
The objective in this project is to look for patterns in the audio features of the songs  and find why people stream these songs the most.
The audio features for each song were extracted using the Spotify Web API and the spotipy Python library.

In this project I processed, integrated and calculated the COVID-19 and World Happiness Report datasets to determine the relationship between the spread of the Coronavirus in a country and the degree of happiness of the inhabitants of that country.

In this project, I went to analyze data of Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. I followed total six steps: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share & Act in following analysis. I used Python to analyze data and spreadsheet program (Google Sheets) to visualize data.

I tried to answer these questions:

  - What are some trends in smart device usage?
  - How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
  - How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy

How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

The bike sharing company wants to analyze their user data to find the main differences in behaviour between their two types of users, the “casual” who pays for each ride and the annual member who pays a yearly subscription to the service.<br/>
